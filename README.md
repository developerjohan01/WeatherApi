## Security

WIP 

This is a iOS project and ProGuard is made for Java/Android.

An alternative could be [Sirius](https://github.com/Polidea/SiriusObfuscator) but it only supports Xcode 9.2 and Swift 4.0. Xcode 9.2 is not supported by MacOs Catalina.

Also see this blog post about "Open Source Code Obfuscation Tool for Protecting iOS Apps" by [Polidea](https://www.polidea.com/blog/open-source-code-obfuscation-tool-for-protecting-ios-apps/). It is talking about Sirius mentioned above.

There are also a lot of interesting articls on the subject of *Hardening* on the [CRYPTOMAThIC blog](https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/), for example [Overview of App & Code Hardening for Mobile Banking Apps](https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/overview-of-app-code-hardening-for-mobile-banking-apps)
